# SpaceDefender

Space Defender is a space combat game where you must destroy the enemy ship as soon as possible. As you destroy parts of the enemy ship, other parts become activiated or more powerful. For example destroying the ship's engines will slow it down, giving you more time to destroy it, however there will be more power to activate more weapon systems, making it harder to destroy the enemy ship.
